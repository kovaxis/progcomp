Burnside lemma

    For a set X, with members x in X, and a group G, with operations g in G, where g(x): X -> X.
    F_g is the set of x which are fixed points of g (ie. { x in X / g(x) = x }).
    The number of orbits (connected components in the graph formed by assigning each x a node and
    a directed edge between x and g(x) for every g) is called M.
    M = the average of the fixed points of all g = (|F_g1| + |F_g2| + ... + |F_gn|) / |G|

    If x are images and g are simmetries, then M corresponds to the amount of objects, |G|
    corresponds to the amount of simmetries, and F_g corresponds to the amount of simmetrical
    images under the simmetry g.

Rational root theorem

    All rational roots of the polynomials with integer coefficients:

    a0 * x^0 + a1 * x^1 + a2 * x^2 + ... + an * x^n = 0

    If these roots are represented as p / q, with p and q coprime,
    - p is an integer factor of a0
    - q is an integer factor of an

    Note that if a0 = 0, then x = 0 is a root, the polynomial can be divided by x and the theorem
    applies once again.

Legendre's formula

    Considering a prime p, the largest power p^k that divides n! is given by:
    
    k = floor(n/p) + floor(n/p^2) + floor(n/p^3) + ...

    Which can be computed in O(log n / log p) time
